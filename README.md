# FolderTree

A simple Python utility to generate and visualize directory tree structures.

## Features

- Generates a tree-like representation of directory structures
- Saves the output to a text file
- Automatically opens the result in Notepad++ (if available)

## Usage

Edit the `folder_structure_to_txt.py` file to set your target directory and output file path:

```python
# Define the target directory and output file path
target_directory = r"C:\Your\Target\Directory"
output_file = r"C:\Path\To\Output\directory_tree.txt"
```

Then run the script:

```
python folder_structure_to_txt.py
```

## Example Output

See the included `directory_tree.txt` for an example of the generated output.
